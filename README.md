# Adstock
## A quick Adstock Calculator in R

This applies a simple exponential decay function to a sequence of media placements over a number of periods, given an assumed "half-life" of media effectiveness.

The half-life (in days), length of period and number of additional periods to calculate are all adjustable.

Dependencies:  ggplot2, scales (both from tidyverse)
